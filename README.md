# Pipelined RISC-V processor 
 Thit repo contains the implementation of the pipelined datapath for the RISC-V processor. It supports the RV32I base integer instruction set, including an implementation of the EBREAK instruction which halts the program counter from updating, and prevents further instructions from being fetched.
